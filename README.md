# Project Name: FMCW Radar GUI

## Introduction

This project is a Python-based desktop application for real-time acquisition (data transmission via UDP), processing, and visualization of radar data. It uses `PyQt` to build the user interface and `PyQtGraph` for efficient graphical display. Main features include:

- Real-time display of raw ADC data from four virtual antennas.
- Real-time display of constellation diagrams for four virtual antennas.
- Real-time display of amplitude and phase fluctuation diagrams for four virtual antennas.
- Real-time display of waterfall for antenna select in UI
- Real-time calculation and display of 1D FFT results.
- Real-time calculation and display of 2D FFT (range-Doppler) results.
- Real-time calculation and display of 2D point clouds.
- Support for saving real-time data to `.mat` files.

This program is specially optimized for radar signal processing. With the high-performance drawing capability of `PyQtGraph`, it ensures smooth GUI experience even when handling high frame rate data.

## Project Structure

Core files of the project may include:

- `Andar_udp.py`: Main program file, containing GUI and data processing logic.
- `Radar_UDP.ui`: UI file designed with Qt Designer.
- `data_processing.py`: Mainly contains radar IQ data reorganization, 1D FFT, 2D FFT, etc.
- `display_pg.py`: Mainly for GUI binding, initialization, and display calls.
- `udp_handler.py`: UDP signal transmission and related work.
- `raw_data.mat`: Radar raw data file saved by the program.

## How to Run

### 1. Dependencies

Before running the project, please make sure you have installed all necessary Python libraries. You can use `pip` to install them:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 pyqtgraph numpy scipy
```

- **`PyQt5`**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **`pyqtgraph`**: For high-performance scientific plotting.
- **`numpy`**: For numerical array processing.
- **`scipy`**: For loading and saving `.mat` files.

### 2. Run the Program

After installing the dependencies, simply run the main program file:

```
python Andar_udp.py
```

### 3. Data Saving

The program supports saving real-time data to `.mat` files. Each time the program starts, it automatically generates a `.mat` file named with the current timestamp, such as `2025_08_20_14_30_00_raw_data_py.mat`, and all processed frame data will be appended to this file.

**Ellipse Fitting:**

Based on the constellation diagram, **ellipse fitting** is added for quantitative analysis of I/Q signal **amplitude consistency** and **phase orthogonality**.

#### **Fitting Metrics:**

- **Axis ratio (b/a)**
  - Definition: Ellipse minor axis / major axis.
  - Meaning: Measures I/Q amplitude consistency.
    - Close to 1.0 → Distribution is nearly circular, good amplitude match.
    - Smaller → More elliptical, indicating amplitude mismatch or high channel correlation.
- **Tilt**
  - Definition: Rotation angle of the ellipse's major axis relative to the I axis.
  - Meaning: Measures I/Q orthogonality.
    - Ideally should be close to 0°.
    - If tilt ≠ 0°, indicates phase error.
  - Note: When the distribution is nearly circular (axis_ratio ≈ 1), tilt direction may be unstable, with ±90° jumps. The code normalizes tilt to the [-45°, +45°] range for intuitive display.

#### **Graphical Elements:**
